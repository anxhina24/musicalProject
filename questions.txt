Part 1
1-Describe briefly the matching and reconciling method chosen.
For storing metadata I choose to create a simple POST request.
If we upload a csv file all the data will be extracted and will be saved on postgres database

2-We constantly receive metadata from our providers, how would
you automatize the process?
If we receive new metadata, we upload the new file and all new datas with be saved on postgres database.


Part 2
1-Imagine that the Single View has 20 million musical works, do
you think your solution would have a similar response time?
Of course No, we will have a delay in response

2-If not, what would you do to improve it?
Using pagination
